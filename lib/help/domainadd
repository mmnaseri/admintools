Usage: sysadmin domainadd {user} {domain}

This command will help you create a domain and set it up for immediate use.

The way this command works is that it will first create a working directory under /home/{user}/sites/{domain} and place everything there.
It will then create various DNS records and set up your BIND9 service so that DNS lookups for your domain will resolve to this server properly.
After that, it will create an Apache2 virtual host and then restart Apache.
At this point, your domain is all ready for use and you can start putting your content online.
