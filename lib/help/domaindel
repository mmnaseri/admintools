Usage: sysadmin domaindel [{options}] {user} {domain}

This command will remove all DNS and Apache2 related configuration created by `domainadd` from your system.
Optionally, you can specify the `-d` option to instruct the command to also remove all user files from your system. This will
effectively remove the `/home/{user}/sites/{domain}` directory from the system.
